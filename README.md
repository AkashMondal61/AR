"Twitch Cosplay" was a team project build during the Hackathon held at Yale University. This extension helps to  the streamers try costumes on their characters. 


In this, we developed an appealing web application using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript to let the users choose the costumes they want to try on. This is me trying the hat feature provided by the application!

## HOW TO USE

- Unzip the folder and double click on the index.html file.

- A window will pop open in your default browser which would look like this - 



- Click on the sunglass, Next window will ask you to "Use your camera". Allow the webcam to be used by this application. The message looks like this -

- Next step is playing along with the arrows and trying different angles to get the item to fit!
